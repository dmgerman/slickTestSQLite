* Introduction

This tutorial is based  on the tutorial by Stephan February [[http://www.hashbangbin.sh/posts/getting-started-scala-%2B-slick-%2B-postgresql-mysql/]]

I have simplified his tutorial and updated it to use sqlite.

This tutorial uses the db: test.db created in the "current directory"

- Drops a table if exists
- Creates a table
- Inserts some tuples (in two inserts)
- Does two selects
  - without a where clause
  - with a where clause


* How to run


Simply clone and

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sbt run
#+END_SRC

The output should be something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Acme, Inc.: 99 Market Street : Groundsville
Superior Coffee: 1 Party Place : Mendocino
Habit Coffee: 190 Pandora St : Victoria
----------------------------------------
Habit Coffee: 190 Pandora St : Victoria
#+END_EXAMPLE

It should create a database test.db in the current directory with a table called suppliers.

Enjoy!
